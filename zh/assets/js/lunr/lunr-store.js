        "excerpt":"we are actively working on bringing many new features in the future releases.    FAQ      Q001: Why another miner?   A: We feel that the competition is good for the end user. In the first releases of PhoenixMiner we focused on the basic features and on the mining speed but we are now working on making our miner easier to use and even faster.   Q002: Can I run several instances of PhoenixMiner on the same rig?   A: Yes, but make sure that each GPU is used by a single miner (use the -gpus, -amd, or -nvidia command-line options to limit the GPUs that given instance of PhoenixMiner actually uses).   Another possible problem is that all instances will use the default CDM remote port 3333, which will prevent proper remote control for all but the first instance. To fix this problem, use the -cdmport command-line option to change the CDM remote port form its default value.      Q003: Can I run PhoenixMiner simultaneously on the same rig with other miners?   A: Yes, but see the answer to the previous question for how to avoid problems.   Q004: What is a stale share?   A: The ethash coins usually have very small average block time (15 seconds in most instances). On the other hand, to achieve high mining speed we must keep the GPUs busy so we can’t switch the current job too often. If our rigs finds a share just after the someone else has found a solution for the current block, our share is a stale share. Ideally, the stale shares should be minimal as same pools do not give any reward for stale shares, and even these that do reward stall shares, give only partial reward for these shares. If the share is submitted too long after the block has ended, the pool may even fully reject it.   Q005: Why is the percentage of stale shares reported by PhoenixMiner smaller than the one shown by the pool?   A: PhonixMiner can only detect the stale shares that were discovered after it has received a new job (i.e. the “very stale”) shares. There is additional latency in the pool itself, and in the network connection, which makes a share stall even if it was technically found before the end of the block from the miner’s point of view. As pools only reports the shares as accepted or rejected, there is no way for the miner to determine the stale shares from the pool’s point of view.   Q006: What is the meaning of the “actual share difficulty” shown by PhoenixMiner when a share is found?   A: It allows you to see how close you were to finding an actual block (a rare event these days for the most miners with reasonable-sized mining rigs). You can find the current difficulty for given coin on sites like whattomine.com and then check to see if you have exceeded it with your maximum share difficulty. If you did, you have found a block (which is what the mining is all about).   Q007: What is the meaning of “effective speed” shown by PhoenixMiner’s statistics?   A: This is a measure of the actually found shares, which determines how the pool sees your miner hashrate. This number should be close to the average hashrate of your rig (usually a 2-4% lower than it) depending you your current luck in finding shares. This statistic is meaningless in the first few hours after the miner is started and will level off to the real value with time.   Q008: Why is the effective hashrate shown by the pool lower than the one shown by PhoenixMiner?   A: There are two reasons for this: stale shares and luck. The stale shares are rewarded at only about 50-70% by most pools. The luck factor should level itself off over time but it may take a few days before it does. If your effective hashrate reported by the pool is consistently lower than the hashrate of your rig by more than 5-7% than you should look at the number of stale shares and the average share acceptance time - if it is higher than 100 ms, try to find a pool that is near to you geographically to lower the network latency. You can also restart your rig, or try another pool.   ","categories": ["documentation"],

If not, click the Create Account button in the upper right corner to complete the registration.        Step 3: Create a mining account. After logging in, click on “Manage Mining Account” to create a mining account.        This is where you will assign a username to the mining account. Enter the appropriate username for the miner to be used on this account.        3. How to get mining software   1) Mining software：   Click to  download and configure PhoenixMiner, Claymore Miner or other mining software.   2) Operating system for mining:   Windows 10: Suitable for those who mine on a work computer. Also, this system is good because it is widely known and does not require complex configuration.   Hive OS:  A mining platform that allows users to more efficiently and easily set up, mine and monitor processes on thousands of farms in one place. Everything you and your team need to keep your farm running at peak efficiency.   Minerstat: Professional remote crypto mining software stack with dedicated OS and mining apps for Windows and ASIC. Minerstat covers all important features such as built-in mining calculator, test, profit switch, diagnostics and dozens of other tools that make the mining manager’s job easier.   MinerOS: Linux-based miner management system that supports cloud package management for mining machines. The system ROM supports U disk and diskless installation and includes embedded original third-party software.   Easy Miner: Supports over 90 types of coins. Allows you to change the pool, coin and wallet for batch mining in one click; one-click batch update of the kernel, software and drivers; and one-click batch overclocking without relying on ShadowsocksR.   4. Set up mining software   1) Configure miners using Windows, HiveOs or Minerstat (NVIDIA and AMD cards):   If this is your first time using HiveOs, check out the Hive OS guide.   If this is your first time using Minerstat, check out  “How to set up mining on Binance pool? ”.   Set up your account using ETH mining. To start using your miner, please log into your Binance Pool mining account to set Binance Pool as your default mining pool.   2) Setup Phoenix miner (NVIDIA and AMD cards):   After downloading the latest version of the mining software unzip it, find the start.bat or start.cmd file, right-click it and select “Edit”.   Replace the existing commands in the file with the commands from the table below that correspond to your chosen coin mining software. .    \t \t\t \t\t\tSoftware \t\t\tCommands \t\t \t\t \t\t\tPhoenixMiner \t\t\tPhoenixMiner.exe -pool ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -wal username1 -worker worker_name -epsw x -asm 2 -dbg -1 -allpools 1 -mode 1 \t\t \t\t \t\t\tClaymore Miner \t\t\tEthDcrMiner64.exe -epool ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -ewal username1 -worker worker_name -epsw x -asm 2 -dbg -1 -allpools 1 -mode 1 \t\t \t   Replace the “username1” with the name of your mining account. Finally, save the .bat file and exit. When you’re ready to start mining, double-click the .bat file.   Follow the above path to download the Phoenix mining software.   Select “Extract to current folder” and locate the batch file “start.bat”.   You can also choose one of these alternative ETH mining pool addresses:   ethash.poolbinance.com:3333 ethash.poolbinance.com:443 ethash.poolbinance.com:25 ethash.poolbinance.com:1800  Monitoring miners and viewing income   After the miner has worked a bit and sent the data to the mining pool (usually it takes 15-20 minutes of mining), you can view the miner’s working status and profitability.   To mine with the Binance Pool, you can log into the official Binance Pool website at pool.binance.com and navigate to ETH in the top right corner.   You can check your income and miner status in the “Statistics” panel and on the “Workers” page.        You can also use the Binance Pool app (click to download). You can view the related information after logging in.   If you have any questions about Ethereum mining or need help, please send an email to poolvip@binance.com for more advice   Ready example    PhoenixMiner.exe -pool ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -wal username1 -worker worker_name -epsw x -asm 2 -dbg -1 -allpools 1 -mode 1 eth pause    Just change username1 to your account name.

You can download PhoenixMiner 0.8.3 from here:   Download Now   Download (mirror)   Linux:  Under Linux you need to replace PhoenixMiner.exe with ./PhoenixMiner in the command-line examples below.   Note that PhoenixMiner supports most of the command-line options of Claymore’s dual Ethereum miner so you can use the same command line options as the ones you would have used with Claymore’s miner.   Pool options   -pool &lt;host:port&gt;Ethash pool address (prepend the host name with ssl:// for SSL pool, or http:// for solo mining).  -wal &lt;wallet&gt;Ethash wallet (some pools require appending of user name and/or worker).  -pass &lt;password&gt;Ethash password (most pools don’t require it, use x as password if unsure).  -worker &lt;name&gt;Ethash worker name (most pools accept it as part of wallet).  -proto &lt;n&gt;Selects the kind of stratum protocol for the ethash pool:  1 miner-proxy stratum spec (e.g. coinotron)  2 eth-proxy (e.g. ethermine, nanopool) - this is the default, works for most pools  3 qtminer (e.g. ethermine, ethpool)  4 EthereumStratum/1.0.0 (e.g. nicehash)  5 EthereumStratum/2.0.0    -coin &lt;coin&gt;Ethash coin to use for devfee to avoid switching DAGs:  auto Auto-detect the coin (default)  eth Ethereum  etc Ethereum Classic  exp Expanse  music Musicoin  ubq UBIQ  pirl Pirl  ella Ellaism  etp Metaverse ETP  whale WhaleCoin  vic Victorium  nuko Nekonium  mix Mix  egem EtherGem  clo Callisto  dbix DubaiCoin  moac MOAC  etho Ether-1  yoc Yocoin  b2g Bitcoiin2Gen  esn Ethersocial  ath Atheios  reosc REOSC  qkc QuarkChain  bci Bitcoin Interest    -stales &lt;n&gt;Submit stales to ethash pool: 1 - yes (default), 0 - no  -pool2 &lt;host:port&gt;Failover ethash pool address.

Use this to test your rig. If you specify only the -bench option, you will benchmark the ethash algorithm. If you want to bench the dual mining, use the options -bench &lt;n&gt; -dcoin blake2s. If you want to benchmark the ProgPOW BCI algorithm, use the options -bench &lt;n&gt; -coin bci    Remote control options    -cdm &lt;n&gt;Selects the level of support of the CDM remote monitoring:  0 disabled  1 read-only - this is the default  2 full (only use on secure connections)    -cdmport &lt;port&gt;Set the CDM remote monitoring port (default is 3333). You can also specify &lt;ip_addr:port&gt; if you have a secure VPN connection and want to bind the CDM port to it  -cdmpass &lt;pass&gt;Set the CDM remote monitoring password  -cdmrsReload the settings if config.txt is edited/uploaded remotely. Note that most options require restart in order to change. Currently the following options can be changed without restarting: -mi, -gt, -sci, -clf, -nvf, -gpow, and most of the hardware control parameters (-tt, -fcm, -fanmin, -fanmax, -powlim, -tmax, -ttli, -cclock, -cvddc, -mclock, -mvddc, -ppf, -straps, -vmt1, -vmt2, -vmt3, -vmr).    Mining options   -amdUse only AMD cards  -acmTurn on AMD compute mode on the supported GPUs. This is equivalent of pressing y in the miner console.  -nvidiaUse only Nvidia cards  -gpus &lt;123 ..n&gt;Use only the specified GPUs (if more than 10, separate the indexes with comma)  -mi &lt;n&gt;Set the mining intensity (0 to 14; 12 is the default for new kernels). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -gt &lt;n&gt;Set the GPU tuning parameter (6 to 400). The default is 15. You can change the tuning parameter interactively with the + and - keys in the miner’s console window. You may specify this option per-GPU. If you don’t specify -gt or you specify value 0, the miner will use auto-tuning to determine the best GT value. Note that when the GPU is dual-mining, it ignores the -gt values, and uses -sci instead.  -sci &lt;n&gt;Set the dual mining intensity (1 to 1000). The default is 30. As you increase the value of -sci, the secondary coin hashrate will increase but the price will be higher power consumption and/or lower ethash hashrate. You can change the this parameter interactively with the + and - keys in the miner’s console window. You may specify this option per-GPU. If you set -sci to 0, the miner will use auto-tuning to determine the best value, while trying to maximize the ethash hashrate regardless of the secondary coin hashrate.  -clKernel &lt;n&gt;Type of OpenCL kernel: 0 - generic, 1 - optimized, 2 - alternative, 3 - turbo (1 is the default) You may specify this option per-GPU.  -clgreen &lt;n&gt;Use the power-efficient (“green”) kernels (0: no, 1: yes; default: 0). You may specify this option per-GPU. Note that you have to run auto-tune again as the optimal GT values are completely different for the green kernels  -clNew &lt;n&gt;Use new AMD kernels if supported (0: no, 1: yes; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -clf &lt;n&gt;AMD kernel sync (0: never, 1: periodic; 2: always; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvKernel &lt;n&gt;Type of Nvidia kernel: 0 auto (default), 1 old (v1), 2 newer (v2), 3 latest (v3). Note that v3 kernels are only supported on GTX10x0 GPUs. Also note that dual mining is supported only by v2 kernels. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvdo &lt;n&gt;Enable Nvidia driver-specific optimizations (0 - no, the default; 1 - yes). Try -nvdo 1 if your are unstable. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvNew &lt;n&gt;Use new Nvidia kernels if supported (0: no, 1: yes; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -nvf &lt;n&gt;Nvidia kernel sync (0: never, 1: periodic; 2: always; 3: forced; default: 1). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -mode &lt;n&gt;Mining mode (0: dual mining if dual pool(s) are specified; 1: ethash only even if dual pools are specified). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -gbase &lt;n&gt;Set the index of the first GPU (0 or 1, default: 1)  -minRigSpeed &lt;n&gt;Restart the miner if avg 5 min speed is below &lt;n&gt; MH/s  -eres &lt;n&gt;Allocate DAG buffers big enough for n epochs ahead (default: 2) to avoid allocating new buffers on each DAG epoch switch, which should improve DAG switch stability. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -daglim &lt;n&gt;(AMD Polaris, Baffin, Tonga, or Fiji cards only) Limit the DAG size to &lt;n&gt; MB to allow mining on 4 GB cards a few weeks after epoch 373 on Windows (or 381 on Linux). The possible values except the exact DAG limit are also 0 (turn off the DAG limit), 1 (automatic DAG limit size, usually 4023 MB under Windows; this is the default). Note that the hashrate will drop significantly with each epoch after the DAG limit is in effect. If the hashrate drops too much (e.g. from 28 MH/s to just 2-3 MH/s, you need to use lower value, for example -daglim 3996 or even lower.  -dagrestart &lt;n&gt;Restart the miner when allocating buffer for a new DAG epoch. The possible values are: 0 - never, 1 - always, 2 - auto (the miner decides depending on the driver version). This is relevant for 4 GB AMD cards, which may have problems with new DAG epochs after epoch 350.  -lidag &lt;n&gt;Slow down DAG generation to avoid crashes when switching DAG epochs (0-3, default: 0 - fastest, 3 - slowest). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -gser &lt;n&gt;Serializing DAG creation on multiple GPUs (0 - no serializing, all GPUs generate the DAG simultaneously, this is the default; 1 - partial overlap of DAG generation on each GPU; 2 - no overlap (each GPU waits until the previous one has finished generating the DAG); 3-10 - from 1 to 8 seconds delay after each GPU DAG generation before the next one)  -gpureset &lt;n&gt;Fully reset GPU when paused (0 - no, 1 - yes; default: no, except on 1080Ti). You may specify this option per-GPU.  -rvram &lt;n&gt;Minimum free VRAM in MB (-1: don’t check; default: 384 for Windows, and 128 for Linux)  -altinitUse alternative way to initialize AMD cards to prevent startup crashes  -wdog &lt;n&gt;Enable watchdog timer: 1 - yes, 0 - no (1 is the default). The watchdog timer checks periodically if any of the GPUs freezes and if it does, restarts the miner (see the -rmode command-line parameter for the restart modes)  -wdtimeout &lt;n&gt;Watchdog timeout (30 - 300; default 45 seconds). You can use this parameter to increase the default watchdog timeout in case it restarts the miner needlessly  -rmode &lt;n&gt;Selects the restart mode when a GPU crashes or freezes: :0: disabled - miner will shut down instead of restarting :1: restart with the same command line options - this is the default :2: reboot (shut down miner and execute reboot.bat)  -log &lt;n&gt;Selects the log file mode: :0: disabled - no log file will be written :1: write log file but don’t show debug messages on screen (default) :2: write log file and show debug messages on screen  -logfile &lt;name&gt;Set the name of the logfile. If you place an asterisk (*) in the logfile name, it will be replaced by the current date/time to create a unique name every time PhoenixMiner is started. If there is no asterisk in the logfile name, the new log entries will be added to end of the same file. If you want to use the same logfile but the contents to be overwritten every time when you start the miner, put a dollar sign ($) character in the logfile name (e.g. -logfile my_log.txt$).  -logdir &lt;path&gt;Set a path where the logfile(s) will be created  -logsmaxsize &lt;n&gt;Maximum size of the logfiles in MB. The default is 200 MB (use 0 to turn off the limitation). On startup, if the logfiles are larger than the specified limit, the oldest are deleted. If you use a single logfile (by using -logfile), then it is truncated if it is bigger than the limit and a new one is created.  -config &lt;name&gt;Load a file with configuration options that will be added to the command-line options. Note that the order is important. For example, if we have a config.txt file that contains -cclock 1000 and we specify command line -cclock 1100 -config config.txt, the options from the config.txt file will take precedence and the resulting -cclock will be 1000. If the order is reversed (-config config.txt -cclock 1100) then the second option takes precedence and the resulting -cclock will be 1100. Note that only one -config option is allowed. Also note that if you reload the config file with c key or with the remote interface, its options will take precedence over whatever you have specified in the command-line.  -timeout &lt;n&gt;Restart miner according to -rmode after n minutes  -pauseat &lt;hh:mm&gt;Pause the miner at hh:mm (24 hours time). You can specify multiple times: -pauseat 6:00,12:00  -resumeat &lt;hh:mm&gt;Resume the miner at hh::mm (24 hours time). You can specify multiple times: -resumeat 8:00,22:00  -gswin &lt;n&gt;GPU stats time window (5-30 sec; default: 15; use 0 to revert to pre-2.8 way of showing momentary stats)  -gsi &lt;n&gt;Speed stats interval (5-30 sec; default: 5; use 0 to disable). The detailed stats are still shown every 45 seconds and aren’t affected by the -gsi value  -astats &lt;n&gt;Show advanced stats from Web sources (0: no; 1: yes). By default the coin exchange rates are updated every 4 hours, and the coin difficulty is updated every 8 hours. You can increase these periods by specifying for example -astats 12, which will increase update periods to 12 and 24 hours respectively  -gpow &lt;n&gt;Lower the GPU usage to n% of maximum (default: 100). If you already use -mi 0 (or other low value) use -li instead. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -li &lt;n&gt;Another way to lower the GPU usage. Bigger n values mean less GPU utilization; the default is 0. You may specify this option per-GPU.  -resetocReset the HW overclocking settings on startup  -leaveocDo not reset overclocking settings when closing the miner    Hardware control options (you may specify these options per-GPU)    -hwm &lt;n&gt;Frequency of hardware monitoring (one setting for all cards, the default is 1): 0 - no HW monitoring or control, 1 - normal monitoring, 2 to 5 - less frequent monitoring.  -tt &lt;n&gt;Set fan control target temperature (special values: 0 - no fan control, negative - fixed fan speed at n %)  -hstats &lt;n&gt;Level of hardware monitoring: 0 - temperature and fan speed only; 1 - temperature, fan speed, and power; 2 - full (include core/memory clocks, voltages, P-states). The default is 1.  -pidle &lt;n&gt;Idle power consumption of the rig in W. Will be added to the GPU power consumption when calculating the total power consumption of the rig.  -ppf &lt;n&gt;The power usage of each GPU will be multiplied by this value to get the actual usage. This value is in percent, so for example if the GPU reports 100 W power usage and you have specified -ppf 106 the GPU power usage will be calculated to be 100 * (106 / 100) = 106 W. This allows you to correct for the efficiency of the PSUs and the individual GPUs. You can also specify this value for each GPU separately.  -prate &lt;n&gt;Price of the electricity in USD per kWh (e.g. -prate 0.1). If specified the miner will calculate the rig daily electricity cost  -fanmin &lt;n&gt;Set fan control min speed in % (-1 for default)  -fanmax &lt;n&gt;Set fan control max speed in % (-1 for default)  -fcm &lt;n&gt;Set fan control mode (0 - auto, 1 - use VBIOS fan control, 2 - forced fan control; default: 0)  -fanidle &lt;n&gt;(Linux only) Set idle fan speed in % (-1 is auto, the default is 20)  -fpwm &lt;n&gt;(Linux only) Fan PWM mode (0 - auto, 1 - direct, 2 - Polaris, 3 - Vega, 4 - Radeon VII, Navi; default: 0)  -tmax &lt;n&gt;Set fan control max temperature (0 for default). If this feature is not supported by the driver, -ttli is set to the same temperature instead  -powlim &lt;n&gt;Set GPU power limit in % (from -75 to 75, 0 for default)  -cclock &lt;n&gt;Set GPU core clock in MHz (0 for default). For Nvidia cards use relative values (e.g. -300 or +400)  -cvddc &lt;n&gt;Set GPU core voltage in mV (0 for default)  -mclock &lt;n&gt;Set GPU memory clock in MHz (0 for default). For Nvidia cards use relative values (e.g. -300 or +400)  -mvddc &lt;n&gt;Set GPU memory voltage in mV (0 for default)  -tstop &lt;n&gt;Pause a GPU when temp is &gt;= n deg C (0 for default; i.e. off)  -tstart &lt;n&gt;Resume a GPU when temp is &lt;= n deg C (0 for default; i.e. off)  -mt &lt;n&gt;VRAM timings (AMD under Windows only): 0 - default VBIOS values; 1 - faster timings; 2 - fastest timings. The default is 0. This is useful for mining with AMD cards without modding the VBIOS.  -leavemtDo not reset memory timing level (-mt) to 0 when closing  -ttli &lt;n&gt;Lower GPU usage when GPU temperature is above n deg C. The default value is 0, which means do not lower the usage regardless of the GPU temperature. This option is useful whenever -tmax is not working. If you are using both -tt and -ttli options, the temperature in -tt should be lower than the -ttli to avoid throttling the GPUs without using the fans to properly cool them first.  -straps &lt;n&gt;Memory strap level (Nvidia cards 10x0 series only). The possible values are 0 to 6. 0 is the default value and uses the default timings from the VBIOS. Each strap level corresponds to a predefined combination of memory timings (-vmt1, -vmt2, -vmt3, -vmr). Strap level 3 is the fastest predefined level and may not work on most cards, 1 is the slowest (but still faster than the default timings). Strap levels 4 to 6 are the same as 1 to 3 but with less aggressive refresh rates (i.e. lower -vmr values).  -straps &lt;n&gt;Memory strap level (AMD Vega cards only). The possible values are 0 to 5. 0 is the default value and uses the default timings from the VBIOS. Each strap level corresponds to a predefined combination of memory timings. Strap level 5 is the fastest level and may not work on most cards, 1 is the slowest (but still faster than the default timings). Note that straps for AMD cards are experimental and may lead to crashes or instability. -vmt1, -vmt2, and -vmt3 parameters have no effect on AMD cards  -vmt1 &lt;n&gt;Memory timing parameter 1 (0 to 100, default 0)  -vmt2 &lt;n&gt;Memory timing parameter 2 (0 to 100, default 0)  -vmt3 &lt;n&gt;Memory timing parameter 3 (0 to 100, default 0)  -vmr &lt;n&gt;Memory refresh rate (0 to 100, default 0). For AMD cards you may also use -rxboost  -nvmem &lt;n&gt;Force using straps on unsupported Nvidia GPUs (0 - do not force, 1 - GDDR5, 2 - GDDR5X). Make sure that the parameter matches your GPU memory type. You can try this if your card is Pascal-based but when you try to use -straps or any other memory timing option, the card is shown as “unsupported”.  -rxboost &lt;n&gt;Memory refresh rate on AMD cards (0 - default value, 1 - predefined value that should work on most cards, 2 to 100 - increasingly aggressive settings). If you want to fine tune the value, you may run the miner with -rxboost 1, write down the corresponding -vmr values that are showed in the log file, and then use -vmr instead with adjusted values.  -vmdag &lt;n&gt;Reset straps to default during DAG generation (default: 1)  -mcdag &lt;n&gt;Reset GPU memory clock to default during DAG generation. Nvidia only, default: 0 (turned off). This may allow you to set higher memory overclock on your Nvidia cards without risking corrupt DAG buffer, which can lead to excessive number of stale shares. Under Linux this option will execute the daggen.sh script (if present in the current directory) for each GPU, passing the GPU index as the first argument, and PCIE bus ID as second argument. The miner will then wait for about 7 seconds before starting DAG generation to allow the script enough time to reset the memory overclock.    General Options    -listList the detected GPUs devices and exit  -v,–versionShow the version and exit  -vsShow short version string (e.g. 4.1c) and exit  -h,–helpShow information about the command-line options and exit    Per-GPU options   Some of the PhoenixMiner options can provide either the same setting for all GPUs, or a different setting for each of the GPUs. For example, to specify the -gt value for all cards you would write -gt 90 but if you want to specify a different GT value for each of the cards, use something like this: -gt 20,15,40,90,90 for a five-GPU mining rig. This would set GT to 20 for the first GPU, 15 for the second GPU, and so on. If you specify less values than you have GPUs, the rest of the GPUs will use the default value for the parameter. You can also use another, more flexible way of specifying different values for the different cards. This is best explained by example: -cclock *:1100,1-3:1090,4:1300 - here we are setting core clock to 1100 MHz for all cards, except the cards 1 to 3, on which it is set to 1090 MHz, and card 4 to 1300 MHz. The part before the colon (:) is the selector, which selects the GPUs for which the value after the colon is applied. The selector can be:   single GPU index: e.g. 5:1000 sets 1000 for the 5th GPU range of GPU indexes: e.g 2-5:1200 sets 1200 for the GPUs 2,3,4, and 5 asterisk, which sets the value for all GPUs label amd or nvidia: e.g. amd:1090 sets the value to 1090 for all AMD cards arbitrary string that starts with letter and can contain letters, numbers and asterisks, which is matched with the GPU name as listed by PhoenixMiner. Example: gtx*1070:+500 will set value +500 for all cards which contain ‘gtx’ and ‘1070’ in their names with anything between them. This will match ‘Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070’ but not ‘Nvidia GeForce 1070’.  Note that if more than one selector matches given card, than only the last one counts. Example: -cclock *:1100,1-4:1090,2:1300 will set card 2 to 1300; cards 1,3, and 4 to 1090; and the rest of the cards to 1100 MHz core clock.  ","categories": ["documentation"],

You can download PhoenixMiner 0.8.3 from here:   Download Now   or:   Mega (mirror)   The file contains the link to download the .zip archive and the password (phoenix) to unlock it.   Inside the archive you will find a file README.txt with installation instructions.   Changelog      New kernels for AMD Vega and Navi GPUs that are slightly faster when the DAG buffer is approaching or passing 4GB in size (the current ETH DAG is close to 4GB). To use these new kernels, you need to use drivers 20.5.1 or later under Win10, or 20.10.x or later under Linux   Automatic re-running auto-tune as needed when switching to a different DAG buffer type (e.g. when switching from ETH to ETC, or back)   Added support for the latest AMD Windows 10 drivers 20.12.1 and 20.11.3   Fixed crash when trying to set -mvddc on very old AMD drivers (including the beta blockchain drivers from 2017)   Other small fixes and improvements   Some notes on the best (or at least some of the better) drivers for AMD cards:   If you have 6GB or 8GB card that is at least Polaris (i.e. 470/480/570/580, Vega, Radeon VII, Navi), you should run at least driver 20.5.1 under Windows 10, or driver 20.10.x under Linux.   If you have 4GB Polaris card (i.e. 470/480/570/580), ideally you should also run drivers 20.5.1 or later. At the very least the drivers should be either 18.12.1.1 to 19.7.5 (inclusive), or 19.12.2 and later. Under Linux, drivers 19.x.x or 20.x.x should be OK for 4GB cards.   Avoid using the 20.40.x, and 20.45.x drivers under Linux.   How to start mining Ethereum Classic   Here is a full command-line example for mining ETC (IMPORTANT: replace the ETC address with your own ETC wallet address in the -wal option, Rig001 is the name of the rig):    Example:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool eu1-etc.ethermine.org:4444 -wal 0xdBa4C80E8a1298228D31D822dAe069Fd624D7B16.rig001 -coin etc    Secure connection:   PhoenixMiner.exe -pool ssl://eu1-etc.ethermine.org:5555 -wal 0x6481c50D9df43314e660716F6dB58f04de71ae0e.Rig001 -coin etc     Here are a couple of epools.txt lines for ETC mining:    Example:   POOL: ssl://eu1-etc.ethermine.org:5555, WAL: 0x6481c50D9df43314e660716F6dB58f04de71ae0e.Rig001, COIN: etc  POOL: etc-eu1.nanopool.org:19999, WAL: 0x6481c50D9df43314e660716F6dB58f04de71ae0e.Rig001, COIN: etc   Happy Mining!
